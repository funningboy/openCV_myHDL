O(n^2) time and O(1) space algorithm ( without any workarounds and hanky-panky stuff! )

Rotate by +90:

Transpose
Reverse each row
Rotate by -90:

Transpose
Reverse each column
Rotate by +180:

Method 1: Rotate by +90 twice

Method 2: Reverse each row and then reverse each column

Rotate by -180:

Method 1: Rotate by -90 twice

Method 2: Reverse each column and then reverse each row

Method 3: Reverse by +180 as they are same
